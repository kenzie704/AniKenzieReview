                <p>
                    the garden of sinners isnt an anime that i thought i would enjoy but after watching all 8 movies it
                    has quickly become one of my favourites when watching the show some of the movies were confusing
                    because it felt like some of the later movies should have been closer to the begining of the show.
                    the main character is one of the best out of the series that i have watched, overall it is a really
                    good watch especially if you like anime that focus a bit more on story over action this show follows
                    the comlicated life of shiki ryougi (or ryougi shiki for the way it is said in japanese).
