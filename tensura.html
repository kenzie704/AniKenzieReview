                <p>
                    That time I got riencarnated as a slime (tensura) is an amazing anime that goes into the life of
                    someone who was killed in his human life then got riencarnated as a slime in a new world filled with
                    magic and creatures. I have enjoyed watching the anime and seeing how the characters develop, I
                    enjoyed what the anime has done and how it has done the world building, at some points the anime can
                    feel slow but the overall story is really enjoyable. This was the first anime that got me to read
                    the light novel as I dont usually enjoy reading but the anime was just really good and I couldnt
                    wait for following seasons so i started reading to follow along with the story .
