                    fate/stay night: unlimated blade works is an amazing anime with some of the best animation in anime,
                    it was released in 2014 and its animation still holds up 11 years later. if you can get into the
                    fate series stay night ubw is a really good anime that expands on what happens in fate zero and
                    finishes up the story, overall a good watch just a bit confussing to get into the series as
                    depending on who you you get a different order to watch it i watched fate zero first this did not
                    ruin the story i would recomend that if watching this start with fate zero then watch this.

                    Fuyuki city-a city surrounded by the ocean and the mountains becomes the setting for an age-old
                    ritual. To realize the mythical holy grail, which is said to grant any wish from its possessor,
                    seven masters are given seven heroic spirits chosen by the grail. Each master will enter into a
                    contract with their assigned servants and battle the other masters and servants to the death until
                    only one pair remain.
