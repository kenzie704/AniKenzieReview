        <h1>the eminence in shadow review!</h1>
        <p>The eminence in shadow is a good anime that has a lot of comedic scenes it is not that serious of an anime, when the main character is his normal self his name is cid most of the time he tries to be a background character the way the show is set its to keep attention of him when he uses his shadow persona he becomes probably the strongest in his show, most of the things he does in the anime is because of money overall this is a fun to watch anime that had me laugthing at a few scenes. i would recomend that if you have watched a decent amount of anime and are looking for one to watch the eminence in shadow is a really good show, if you have not watched a lot of anime maybe this anime will be fine but there is some fanservice which can put new anime watchers of the show.</p>
        <h2>the eminence in shadow description!</h2>
        <p>when cid is isekai'd to another world, he creates an underground organization to live out a fight against a made-up cult. Little does he know the cult is real, and they're not happy his power fantasy just impeded their plans.</p>
