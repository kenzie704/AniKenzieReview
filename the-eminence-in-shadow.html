                    The eminence in shadow is a good anime that has a lot of comedic scenes it is not that serious of an
                    anime, when the main character is his normal self his name is cid most of the time he tries to be a
                    background character the way the show is set its to keep attention of him when he uses his shadow
                    persona he becomes probably the strongest in his show, most of the things he does in the anime is
                    because of money overall this is a fun to watch anime that had me laugthing at a few scenes. I would
                    recomend that if you have watched a decent amount of anime and are looking for one to watch the
                    eminence in shadow is a really good show, if you have not watched a lot of anime maybe this anime
                    will be fine but there is some fanservice which can put new anime watchers of the show.

                    When cid is isekai'd to another world, he creates an underground organization to live out a fight
                    against a made-up cult. Little does he know the cult is real, and they're not happy his power
                    fantasy just impeded their plans.
